# Event-Driven Order Notification System on AWS

This project implements an **event-driven order processing system** using AWS services including DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, Lambda, and CloudWatch.

The system architecture enables **asynchronous order processing**, fault tolerance, and scalability by decoupling the message producer (order publisher) from the message consumer (order processor).

## üì¶ **What the CloudFormation Template Does**

The provided CloudFormation template (`template.yaml`) automatically creates and configures:

1. **DynamoDB Table**  
   - Name: `Orders`  
   - Partition Key: `orderId`

2. **SNS Topic**  
   - Name: `OrderTopic`

3. **SQS Queue**  
   - Name: `OrderQueue-CF`

4. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**  
   - Name: `OrderQueueDLQ-CF`  
   - Configured to receive messages after 3 failed processing attempts

5. **SNS Subscription**  
   - Subscribes `OrderQueue-CF` to `OrderTopic`

6. **IAM Role**  
   - Grants Lambda permissions for DynamoDB, SQS, and CloudWatch Logs

7. **Lambda Function** (`ProcessOrderLambda`)  
   - Runtime: Python 3.12  
   - Triggered by `OrderQueue-CF`  
   - Reads messages from SQS  
   - Parses SNS-wrapped messages  
   - Logs order ID  
   - Stores order in DynamoDB

---

## üèóÔ∏è **How the System Works**

1. A message is published to the **SNS topic** (`OrderTopic`).
2. SNS forwards the message to the **SQS queue** (`OrderQueue-CF`).
3. The **Lambda function** is automatically triggered by SQS when a new message arrives.
4. Lambda reads the message ‚Üí logs the `orderId` ‚Üí saves the order to **DynamoDB**.
5. If Lambda fails to process the message **3 times**, it is sent to the **Dead Letter Queue**.

## üöÄ **How to Deploy**

1. Go to **AWS Console ‚Üí CloudFormation ‚Üí Create Stack**.
2. Upload `template.yaml` and create the stack.
3. Wait for stack status to become **CREATE_COMPLETE**.
4. The system will be fully provisioned and ready.

---

## üìù **Notes**

- All resources created by this template are named with `-CF` suffix to avoid conflicts.
- Make sure to delete the stack after use to avoid unnecessary charges.

---

## ‚úÖ **Outputs**

After deployment, the stack outputs:
- DynamoDB table name
- SNS topic ARN
- SQS queue URLs
- Lambda function name

## üìö **Description**

This project demonstrates a serverless, event-driven architecture for reliable and scalable order processing using AWS managed services.
